## AI Pair Programmer Breakdown
Coding CoPilots like GitHub CoPilot, TabNine, and Kite are tools developers can use that automate the coding process. These tools use artificial intelligence to autocomplete your code based on your projects existing code, context given by commented code, and public or stored code from its users. In this blog I will be focusing on GitHub CoPilot.

The AI Programmer with the most notoriety by far has been **GitHub CoPilot**. On June 29th, 2021, GitHub announced a technical preview of the CoPilot. What GitHub CoPilot aims to acheive is to "help you write code faster and with less work". The tool is availble for a direct install as a plug-in/extension  into your choice of one of its many compatible IDE's but you will not have access to the tool as their is a waitlist (use the link in sources if interested), but once approved you can sign in with your GitHub account to have access. It is currently free as its only a technical preview, but GitHub plans to release a full paid version in the future.

### The AI

### My Experience
I actually enrolled in the Github CoPilot waitlist months ago and have had a few days to play around with the tool at the time of writing this blog. Take my expereince though with a grain of salt as i've had limited time with the tool and I'm a student and don't currently have a developer position with an employer. 

## Should Developers Fear or Embrace the CoPilot
With the emergence of this new tool, it begs to ask several questions.

- Will this make me more efficient as a developer?

There is a common narrative amongst developers that a big part of being an efficient developer is being an efficient 'googler'. While we must admit that googling itself can be too much of a crutch at times, it is often much faster to look on stack overflow for a quick fix. Not every line of code or function needs to be given 100% of your attention and years of refined coding skill. Some things just need to barely get the job done and thats fine. Stack overflow and other sites help to serve that exact purpose, but here's where it starts to get a little bit different with these AI CoPilot's. At times working with this tool did feel like too much of a crutch. With resources like stack overflow, they at least cultivate the process of reading other people's code or explanation and you can walk away with a better understanding of why your code failed to work. With the CoPilot you are spoon fed the entire functions. Theses functions can be complex and hard to understand but sure enough, it usually works. On one hand you could say you could accomplish your tasks for the day that much faster which is that efficiencey is all about?

- Has AI begun to work it's way into replacing jobs of developers?
- Is my private code safe since the AI will be learning from it?
- Will it always write good quality code?
